# react-render-props-components

Components intended for React using render props  
NB : This is just a work in progress for now

## Installation

`npm install --save react-render-props-components`

## Components

* Sorter
* Filter
* DataMixer
* Pager
* Results
* RowCounter
* Table

## Usage

On top of your component file :

```js
const mc = require('react-render-props-components');
const { Filter } = mc;
```

Each component basically keeps state and exposes access to it and a modification function.

```JSX
<Filter>
  ({ setFilter, filterFunction, filter }) => (
    <div>
      <yourInput setFilter={setFilter} />
      <yourComponent filter={filter} filterFunction={filterFunction} />
    </div>
  )}
</Filter>
```

```js
  function yourInput(props) {
    const { setFilter } = props;
    return(
      <input onChange={e => setFilter(e.currentTarget.value)}>
    )
  }
```

```js
function yourComponent(props) {
  const { filter, filterFunction } = props;
  const data = ['someValue', 'otherValue', 'oneLastValue'];
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current filter is: {filter}</p>
      <ul>{filterFunction(data).map(element => <li>{element}</li>)}</ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Components details

* Sorter (TBD)
* Filter

```JSX
export default class Filter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { filter: '' };
    this.filterFunction = this.filterFunction.bind(this);
    this.setFilter = this.setFilter.bind(this);
  }
  setFilter(value) {
    this.setState({ filter: value });
  }
  filterFunction(lines) {
    return Array.prototype.filter.call(
      lines,
      line =>
        this.state.filter.length === 0 ||
        JSON.stringify(line).indexOf(this.state.filter) > -1
    );
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children({
      setFilter: this.setFilter,
      filterFunction: this.filterFunction,
      filter: this.state.filter
    });
  }
}
```

* DataMixer (TBD)
* Pager (TBD)
* Results (TBD)
* RowCounter (TBD)
* Table (TBD)

## Motivations

1.  Why are the functions provided the way they are?

    Functions provided by some components (like `sortFunction` and `filterFunction`) are not necessarily in the form you would expect.  
    For instance, most would have anticpated a sortFunction to be passed to an array like `myArray.sort(sortFunction)`.

    However, providing a function with the array as a parameter allows to chain (or compose) functions, like you can see in DataMixer.

    You can see in the implementation details that the component internally uses `Array.prototype[method].call`. I know I could have used Array.from but the support isn't as good.

2.  Why did you even bother?

    I wanted to play with the concept of render props and ended up creating a whole table sortable, filterable with some other goodies so I thought this might be of some interest to others.

Sure, just make a PR. :)  
Use Prettier and ESLint if you can.
